# k-level-reasoning
MPhys Physics master's research thesis, focusing on developing agent-based models of game learning and behavioral dynamics analysis and extending these to include k-levels of recursive bounded rationality. Types of attractor (chaotic, stable point, limit cycle) governing resulting dynamics were characteristed through largest Lyapunov exponents and variance of evolving mixed strategy.
